# TwitterSQL

When Twitter first started out, its engineers used MySQL as a backend relational database. 

There are two key operations of twitter that my code supports:
a) Users post tweets. We are ignoring hashtags. 

b) Users retrieve all of the tweets posted by all users followed by that user. 
This set of tweets – which the user sees when he or she opens up the twitter app 
on a smart phone – is known as the user’s home timeline.
